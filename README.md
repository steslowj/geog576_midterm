A repo for UW-Mad Geog 576 Midterm Project

## Project Summary
This project is a web map using ArcGIS Online JavaScript code to create a responsive web-map with JavaScript and various hosted datasources, incorporating an editable feature layer and a legend. 

My project is a database of dragons across the world, showing the blurry line between folklore, history, myth, and biology. I have included some data points for dragons as a starter to the database, but the intention for this website is to share with others to hopefully enrich the database from multiple perspectives, cultures, and backgrounds.

Layers include:
<ul>
  <li>Editable <a href="https://uw-mad.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=8160c28ee5ba442c9534e379134e47cd&view=table&sortOrder=desc&sortField=defaultFSOrder#overview">dragon feature layer</a> created by me. This is a Results Feature Layer as part of a custom Survey 123 database.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=08fbd2c0db94442db4e4835092dcc01b#overview">Global Terrsetial Species Richness and Rarity Patterns (0.25 degree)</a> by Map of Life on the Living Atlas.</li>
